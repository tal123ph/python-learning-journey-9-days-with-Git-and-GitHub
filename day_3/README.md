# Day 4: Loops and Iteration

This folder contains 5 Python programs covering various aspects of loops and iteration in Python.

## Topics Covered

1.  **For loops and while loops**
2.  **Range function**
3.  **Break and continue statements**
4.  **Nested loops**
5.  **Loop patterns (counting, accumulating)**

## Files Description

-   **01_for_loops_range.py**: Demonstrates the `for` loop and how to use the `range()` function for generating sequences of numbers.
-   **02_while_loops.py**: Shows how `while` loops work, including a basic countdown and a simulated user input scenario.
-   **03_break_continue.py**: Explains how to alter the flow of a loop using `break` (to exit) and `continue` (to skip the current iteration).
-   **04_nested_loops.py**: Illustrations of nested loops (loops inside loops) creating multiplication tables and coordinate grids.
-   **05_loop_patterns.py**: Implements common loop patterns such as accumulating a sum, counting occurrences, and finding a maximum value.

## How to Run

You can run each file individually using Python:

```bash
python 01_for_loops_range.py
python 02_while_loops.py
python 03_break_continue.py
python 04_nested_loops.py
python 05_loop_patterns.py
```
